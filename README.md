# OCaml

OCaml is a general purpose programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety.

## Why OCaml?

Some compelling reasons to learn and use OCaml:

* Hybrid vigor - OCaml is a functional programming language, but also an imperative language, and also an object-oriented language. This means you can mix and match paradigms at will. If you need extreme speed or frugal memory usage and the functional aspects are getting in your way, you can write an imperative function or two (not an option with a purely functional language like Haskell). And you needn't structure your entire application in an object-oriented fashion (the way you must with Java, for example) -- only the parts where that's appropriate.
